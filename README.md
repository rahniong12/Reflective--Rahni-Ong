## Week 2
### What have I learnt this week?
This week was based around understanding complex adaptive systems with many model thinking. Specifically, I learnt how models can help us build and improve our understanding of complex adaptive systems. In understood this concept through an introduction to what models are, types of models, why model (4 reasons), the seven uses of models and the wisdom hierarchy. Also this week, I learnt the science of many models. This involved looking the idea of putting one model to many uses to better understand complex adaptive systems.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before? What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection, since I am new to this subject and the concepts within it, many insights were gained. Week 2 content included looking at what a model is and the uses of models. This content was similar to year 12 biology, whereby we discussed how models simplify a complex process (eg. in biology a model of a DNA double helix simplifies the structure and formation of nitrogenous bonds) and their multiple functions with the acronym REDCAPE. This included learning about how one model serves many functions, provide a foundation for tackling all sorts of real world problems. For example through the one to many approach, social scientists had applied models of interacting particles to explain poverty traps, variation in crime rates, and even economic growth across countries. From this concept, insights were gained into how models can be both flexible and creative, whilst making us more wise individuals.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I encountered this week was staying focused during the 3 hours of class time. I also often found myself behind as I write down notes and miss out on extra notes the teacher was explaining. Upon reflecting, I did not handle this well as I spent time after class finishing notes and going through Canvas modules for extra information.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To stay focused, I am going to utilise the 10 minute break times with better purpose. I am going to do this by getting up and walking around or having something to eat or drink. I anticipate I will gain more energy and hence will be inclined to actively listen in class and stay focused. Also, I am going to read the Canvas modules before class so I have an understanding of what will be taught during the upcoming lesson.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from 
Reflecting upon this lesson, the theory which proved to be useful was the “wisdom of the crowd” concept. This concept comes from diversity, which involves having people that use different models, different variables and different viewpoints. From this, I learn that I can leverage the “wisdom of the crowd” within my own thinking and problem solving next time I am confronted with a complex adaptive system. Another piece of theory which was also useful was “many model thinking”, which involves applying a single model across multiple domains. This can be done by reassigning names and identifiers and modifying assumptions.
