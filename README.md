## Week 2
### What have I learnt this week?
This week was based around understanding complex adaptive systems with many model thinking. Specifically, I learnt how models can help us build and improve our understanding of complex adaptive systems. In understood this concept through an introduction to what models are, types of models, why model (4 reasons), the seven uses of models and the wisdom hierarchy. Also this week, I learnt the science of many models. This involved looking the idea of putting one model to many uses to better understand complex adaptive systems.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before? What insights have I gained?
Upon reflection, since I am new to this subject and the concepts within it, many insights were gained. Week 2 content included looking at what a model is and the uses of models. This content was similar to year 12 biology, whereby we discussed how models simplify a complex process (eg. in biology a model of a DNA double helix simplifies the structure and formation of nitrogenous bonds) and their multiple functions with the acronym REDCAPE. This included learning about how one model serves many functions, provide a foundation for tackling all sorts of real world problems. For example through the one to many approach, social scientists had applied models of interacting particles to explain poverty traps, variation in crime rates, and even economic growth across countries. From this concept, insights were gained into how models can be both flexible and creative, whilst making us more wise individuals.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I encountered this week was staying focused during the 3 hours of class time. I also often found myself behind as I write down notes and miss out on extra notes the teacher was explaining. Upon reflecting, I did not handle this well as I spent time after class finishing notes and going through Canvas modules for extra information.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
To stay focused, I am going to utilise the 10 minute break times with better purpose. I am going to do this by getting up and walking around or having something to eat or drink. I anticipate I will gain more energy and hence will be inclined to actively listen in class and stay focused. Also, I am going to read the Canvas modules before class so I have an understanding of what will be taught during the upcoming lesson.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from 
Reflecting upon this lesson, the theory which proved to be useful was the “wisdom of the crowd” concept. This concept comes from diversity, which involves having people that use different models, different variables and different viewpoints. From this, I learn that I can leverage the “wisdom of the crowd” within my own thinking and problem solving next time I am confronted with a complex adaptive system. Another piece of theory which was also useful was “many model thinking”, which involves applying a single model across multiple domains. This can be done by reassigning names and identifiers and modifying assumptions.

## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
This week was based around introducing models of how people: behave, make decisions, conceal or reveal hidden information, add value and the power they have in groups and finally, solve problems in a group solution.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before? What insights have I gained?
This week I learnt more about modelling casual interactions, specifically modelling the way people behave. I always thought behaviour was a simple process, but this lesson taught me that there are many systems which make it a complex model. Models can be: rational (based on the assumption that people behave to optimise their goals), behavioural (modelling people as close as possible to how they really behave) or rule based (use psychology to figure out certain rules that people seem to be using and how this predi.cts how they will acts). This knowledge gave me insight into how diverse casual interactions are, with many models deriving from a simple, yet complex process
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
This week, my class focus had improved and I managed to keep up with content, hence proving my new strength. However, a challenge I encountered today was understanding the content with real life application. I handled this situation well by listening to the examples provided in class and writing down extra notes to help understand it better, for example the “prospect theory” example within the behavioural model.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, to see if I understand the content well, I am going to look through the extra examples on canvas and see if I can work the solutions out. If I am unsuccessful, I will then ask my peers or teachers for help through the discussion board. This will assist me in understanding the content better of how these models have applications in the real world.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory which proved to be useful was the problem solving. This involved content to do with how individuals and teams go about problem solving. I learnt that problem solving is a process of perspectives, heuristics, team diversity and recombination, which leads to innovation. The content has given me a framework of how someone’s perspectives, ideas and solutions combine with others to create good ideas. This information proved to be useful as I will be working individually on my reflections, but also in a team for the problem modelling assessment, hence demonstrating its importance in my university studies.

## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
This week was based around representing human centred complex systems. Specifically, I learnt about three ways to model most complex adaptive systems; system dynamics models, network models and agent based models. From here, I learnt the basics of each method and ways they are implemented.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before? What insights have I gained?
An insight I gained which I did not know before was that all our systems are made up of interacting loops, and consequently system behaviour develops. Specifically within system dynamics, these models display behaviour through interdependencies and improve our capacity to think. For example, a casual loop diagram consists of an interacting loop or loops in which interdependencies exist, representing the relationships between variables (eg. a casual loop diagram between procrastination and stress). I also gained insight on the parts which consist within a system dynamics model (sources, sinks, stocks and flows) and how they implemented with a real life example of an amusement park. 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I encountered this week was communication with my group in terms of beginning our many modelling assessment. Communication was a challenge as our group knew we had to start brainstorming possible topics for our assignment, but did not know where to start as we all had different ideas for what we individually wanted to do and how to approach it. We handled this well by allocating a week to research our individual topics and brainstorming models, collaborating on a team google docs.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, in order to improve team communication, it would be ideal to set up a Microsoft Teams or Zoom call. In our situation, voice communication would have been more effective than digital communication so that ideas and thoughts could be discussed quicker. This would of allowed better use of time and would of resulted in a chosen topic to base our assignment on. 
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon the content this week, the theory of networks proved to be useful as I had particular interest in modelling social media, specifically how social behaviour arises from network interactions. The logical of network formation content included a focus on three simple ways that networks can form, one of which was a small-world formation. From the content, I learnt that small-world formations can represent social networks, as some nodes connect to other nodes near them, and then these nodes randomly connect to other nodes far away. Hence, this was relevant to my assignment as it allowed me to formulate a many model thinking mindset of how social media can be represented through models such as the small-worlds network.

## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
This week was based around how interactions and decisions aggregate in a complex system. Content within this that I learnt included probability distributions (aggregation), normal distributions (regularity), long-tail distributions (extremes) and linear models.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before? What insights have I gained?
Reflecting upon this week’s content, I had some knowledge of using probability distributions, normal distributions and linear models to solve simple problems from my high school studies in mathematics advanced. However, a new insight I gained was the concept of using it in modelling complex systems. For example, I learnt that probability distributions help model our world, in a way which allows us to describe and predict the probability of an event or estimate the variability of occurrence. In order to use a probability distribution model in this way, we must define characteristics of the variables whose behaviour we are trying to describe, and then identify the right distribution which should be applied to model the given event. I also learnt about the concept of aggregation. Aggregation is defined as to collect a number of distinct parts into a whole. In probability, aggregation allows us to understand how complex patterns and outcomes arise from simple rules, (i.e. how preferences between individuals aggregate). Also, within a normal distribution, I learnt the central limit theorem can be an effective model for the aggregation of decisions in groups of people (i.e. common choices aggregate around the mean).
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Reflecting from last week’s challenge, my team improved communication with an hour long group call discussing our chosen topic for the assignment, in the end coming up with a specific topic to brainstorm on. However, this week’s group challenge was time management. Although progress was made during the call, the group needed to discuss many other elements to the assessment (i.e which three models and allocating dot points within the criteria for each group member to work on). My team did not handle this well as we have not allocated another group call for the week.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, in order to improve time management, I would have made better use of team communication time during the group call, or made more time during my week to allow for another call. I anticipate that this would have allowed better time management as the three models would have been discussed and finalised and more time to individually research our own criteria dot point would have been allocated.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory which proved to be useful was the probability distributions content. As our group’s specific topic was how social media gather’s data on targeted users to spread information about advertisements, theory provided me knowledge of how probability is used to estimate how many potential customers will be likely to react positively to specific campaigns, based on their consumption patterns. This content was useful was I considered possibly a probability model could be used as one of our three models, or even discussed as a pre-existing model.

## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
This week was based on how complex systems change and evolve over time. Within this, I learnt random walks, Markov models and Lyapunov functions. This week I also learnt how ideas, information, behaviours and diseases spread through looking at models of concavity and convexity, broadcast, diffusion and contagion.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before? What insights have I gained?
In my high school mathematics advanced studies, I learnt about functions because ‘concave’ or ‘convex’. Also in high school biology, I learnt about concave and convex lenses for the eye. However, this subject has given me a new insight about concave and convex models, making me a more complex thinker. I knew that a convex function value increases by a larger amount as we increase a variable’s value. However, I learnt that it can be modelled, remembering it by a given example: a chef adds a new spice to his repertoire, which increases the number of spice combinations by a larger amount. I also knew that concave functions have slopes that decrease. However I learnt that it can be modelled, remembering it by a given example: the more leisure, money, ice cream, or even time spent with loved ones, the less we value having more of it.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I encountered this week was finding research on my allocated criteria dot point (2.3-identifying current models and 3.1-explaining the group’s three chosen models). I found this a challenge as I wanted to make sure I was researching the correct information so the rest of my team’s information would flow concisely. I also wanted to manage my time well from last week so no time was wasted on the wrong research. This week, I handled my research skills well, as well the team improving our time management and communication skills collectively.
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, I would have allocated another meeting with the group to make sure we were all on the same page in terms of what we were researching for our own individually set dot point. This would have allowed better use of research time. Next time, I am also going to re-read the content on Canvas, for broad information, and then look into scholar articles and books for more in depth research.
### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory which proved to be useful came from the broadcast and diffusion models. This content was useful as it related to the group’s assignment topic of how information spreads about advertisements within social media. From previous knowledge, I knew that many products and pieces of information spread by word of mouth. However, I learnt that we could model these environments through broadcast and diffusion, resulting in a Bass model, which plays a central role in marketing. Hence, this theory is useful for my further research of how to model our chosen topic.

## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about part 1 of complexity and emergent behaviour. I learnt that there are three types of emergent behaviour; social contagion, coordination and culture and social learning. Within this, I learnt how things spread through peer effects by modelling Schelling’s segregation model, Grandovetter’s riot model and standing ovation. I also learnt models of culture through pure coordination games and Axelrod’s culture model. Lastly, I learnt about social learning by modelling the replicator dynamics model.
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before? What insights have I gained?
This week, I gained an insight on culture, specifically how different groups function and how each group has implicit trust, norms and mental shortcuts. I learnt this through coordination games, which was interesting as I became wiser on my sense of cultural differences. A model within coordination games included the ketchup question; where do you store your ketchup. Personally, I know ketchup as ‘tomato sauce’, which I learnt is a cultural difference. Also, I keep tomato sauce in the fridge. The insight gained from coordination game modelling updating my thinking as I learnt that most people in the US store it in the fridge, but most people in the UK store it in the cupboard. This ultimately comes down to how one’s norms and mental shortcuts are passed down from their parents, hence it is therefore cultural. I also learnt about another model of electrical plugs. Everyone in one country wants to coordinate to one plug, but there may be differences across countries. This also updated my thinking as a regular international traveller and having to buy a new plug or universal plug for each country visited.
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge I had this week was with time management due to a busy week of assessments from other subjects. This week involved submissions based on group work, so a lot of group calls and individually allocated work had to be completed. However, I managed this well. As well as other subjects, I did a check in with this subject’s group to make sure we were all on the same track and no one was falling behind. My team seemed to be on track and I could see this from the information gathered on our google doc. 
### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, I would start my assessments earlier in order to improve my time management. I would have also initiated a group call, however I did not have time to as I figured out the assessment was due in another week so it was not my main priority. However, as the upcoming date is approaching, it would be ideal to set up a group call to again, to checkup on each other, make sure information relates to the question and most importantly, meets the criteria.
